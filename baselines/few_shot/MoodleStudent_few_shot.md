You are a software tester. You will be given a functional description of a Moodle (student role) module. Your task is to generate UI test cases for it.

There are three types of test cases:

**Positive test case** — A valid user action that should succeed. The system receives correct input and produces the expected outcome.

**Negative test case** — An invalid or missing input that should cause the system to reject the action and show an error.

**Edge test case** — An unusual but technically valid input that tests the limits of the system (e.g. empty fields, maximum length, boundary values).

Here are examples from the Moodle Student system:

```json
{
  "tc_id": "P-001",
  "category": "positive",
  "test_case": "Submit an assignment using the online text editor",
  "preconditions": ["User logged in as Student", "An assignment with online text submission is open and within the due date"],
  "steps": [
    "1. Navigate to the Assignment page from the Course page",
    "2. Click 'Add submission'",
    "3. Enter <submission text> in the online text editor",
    "4. Click 'Save changes'"
  ],
  "expected_result": "Submission status row updates to 'Submitted for grading'; Last modified timestamp reflects the submission time",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

```json
{
  "tc_id": "N-001",
  "category": "negative",
  "test_case": "Attempt to log in with an incorrect password",
  "preconditions": ["A registered student account exists"],
  "steps": [
    "1. Navigate to the Moodle login page",
    "2. Enter <valid username> in the Username field",
    "3. Enter <wrong password> in the Password field",
    "4. Click 'Log in'"
  ],
  "expected_result": "An inline error message is displayed; the Password field is cleared; the Username field retains the entered value",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

```json
{
  "tc_id": "E-001",
  "category": "edge",
  "test_case": "Filter the Timeline block with a date range that contains no upcoming activities",
  "preconditions": ["User logged in as Student", "No activities are due within the next 7 days"],
  "steps": [
    "1. Navigate to the Dashboard",
    "2. In the Timeline block, select 'Next 7 days' from the time range dropdown"
  ],
  "expected_result": "The Timeline block displays an empty state message indicating no upcoming activities within the selected range",
  "priority": "medium"
}
```

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** The examples above are strictly for formatting purposes. Do NOT limit your output to 3 test cases. You must generate an EXHAUSTIVE and COMPREHENSIVE list of test cases that fully cover every single behavior, edge case, and scenario mentioned in the functional description. It is common to generate 10-20 test cases per module.

Now read the following functional description and generate test cases for it.

<module_name>{Module name}</module_name>

<description>
{Functional description text}
</description>

Return a JSON object in this exact format. No markdown, no extra text:

{
  "module": "Module Name",
  "category": "all",
  "test_cases": [
    {
      "tc_id": "string",
      "category": "positive | negative | edge",
      "test_case": "short descriptive name",
      "preconditions": ["..."],
      "steps": ["1. ...", "2. ..."],
      "expected_result": "what the tester sees after the last step",
      "priority": "high | medium | low"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 0,
    "high_priority": 0,
    "medium_priority": 0,
    "low_priority": 0
  }
}
