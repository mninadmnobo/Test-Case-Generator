### [TC-002] Unknown Title
**Category**: `positive` | **Verification Type**: `same_actor_navigation` | **Coverage**: `partial`

**Coverage Note**: *Creation of the floating rate and its base-flag can be fully verified in-app. Automatic adjustment of linked loan products' effective interest rates can only be verified if one or more loan products are already linked to this floating rate (and their effective rates are recalculated/displayed). If no loan products are linked, that side-effect cannot be observed by this test and requires a separate cross-entity verification.*

#### Verification Plan

**Pre-Check**
- **Navigate To**: `Admin -> Floating Rates page (Floating Rates listing)`
- **Observe**:
  - List of floating rates with columns: Floating Rate Name, Is Base Lending Rate, Is Active, Created By
  - Count of rows where Is Base Lending Rate = true (record current count)
  - Verify that no floating rate with the test name (<floating rate name>) exists prior to creation

**Post-Check**
- **Navigate To**: `Admin -> Floating Rates page (Floating Rates listing) and open the newly created floating rate detail`
- **Observe**:
  - Presence of a floating rate row with Floating Rate Name = <floating rate name>
  - Is Base Lending Rate flag set to true for that floating rate
  - Is Active flag value as set during creation (checked or unchecked)
  - In the floating rate detail, Rate Periods table contains a row with From Date = <from date>, Interest Rate = <interest rate percentage>, and Is Differential Rate = false
  - Count of rows where Is Base Lending Rate = true (should be 1 after creation)

**Expected Change**: A new floating rate with the specified name appears in the Floating Rates listing and in its detail view, the 'Is Base Lending Rate' flag is set. The Rate Periods table includes the specified From Date and Interest Rate with Is Differential Rate unchecked. There is at most one floating rate marked as base lending rate (any previously marked base is unset by the system). If loan products are linked to this floating rate, their effective interest rates should update per the new rate period (verification of linked loan product rate changes is conditional and may require navigating to those loan product details or loan accounts).

- **Navigate To**: `Floating Rates -> List; Loan Products -> Product Detail for product(s) expected to reference this floating rate`
- **Observe**:
  - Floating Rates list does NOT contain <floating rate name> (or note current presence if re-run)
  - For each loan product expected to be linked: current configured interest rate display and whether a Floating Rate linkage is shown (linked floating rate name or blank) — record the displayed interest rate value(s)

**Post-Check**
- **Navigate To**: `Floating Rates -> List -> Open the newly created <floating rate name> -> Rate Periods table; then Loan Products -> Product Detail for product(s) expected to reference this floating rate`
- **Observe**:
  - Floating Rates list contains <floating rate name>
  - Floating Rate detail shows Rate Periods table with two rows
  - Rate Period row 1 fields: From Date equals entered <from date>, Interest Rate equals entered <interest rate percentage>, Is Differential Rate is unchecked
  - Rate Period row 2 fields: From Date equals entered <from date>, Interest Rate equals entered <interest rate percentage>, Is Differential Rate is checked
  - For each linked loan product: the product detail shows the floating rate linkage to <floating rate name> (if product-level linkage exists) or the loan's effective interest rate calculation shows the floating rate as the source
  - For each linked loan product: the displayed effective interest rate (or the preview/calculated rate) matches the expected result based on the applicable Rate Period (absolute rate used for non-differential period; base lending rate ± differential percent applied for the differential period)

**Expected Change**: A new Floating Rate named <floating rate name> exists and its detail contains two Rate Period rows with the first row as an absolute rate (Is Differential Rate unchecked) and the second row as a differential rate (Is Differential Rate checked). Loan products that reference this floating rate reflect the floating rate linkage and their effective interest rates are updated according to the applicable Rate Period (absolute periods apply the listed rate; differential periods apply the base lending rate plus or minus the differential).

- **Observe**:
  - rate periods table (each row shows From Date, Interest Rate, Is Differential Rate)
  - count of existing rate period rows
  - floating rate name
  - if shown: list of linked loan products or linked entities (product name, linkage indicator)
  - for one linked loan product (pick one if listed): displayed effective interest or note indicating floating rate is applied

**Post-Check**
- **Navigate To**: `Floating Rates -> <existing floating rate> (Detail view)`
- **Observe**:
  - rate periods table (each row shows From Date, Interest Rate, Is Differential Rate)
  - presence of a new Rate Period row with From Date = <from date>, Interest Rate = <interest rate percentage>, Is Differential Rate = <as set>
  - floating rate name (shows <updated floating rate name> if changed)
  - if shown: list of linked loan products (product name, linkage indicator)
  - for one linked loan product (same as pre-check): displayed effective interest or note indicating floating rate usage / updated effective rate for dates >= <from date>

**Expected Change**: The Floating Rate detail now includes a new Rate Period row with the specified From Date and Interest Rate and the configured Differential flag. If the floating rate name was edited, the detail header reflects the updated name. For loan products linked to this floating rate (if they are displayed), their effective interest metadata or preview reflects the application of the new rate period for applicable dates; full recalculation of active loans may be asynchronous and performed by scheduled jobs.

#### Verification Plan

**Actor A (Role: `user with Bulk Import permission (e.g., admin)`)**
- **Action**: Execute the steps from the core test case: navigate to Admin > Organization > Bulk Import, upload the valid Clients import file for the Clients import card and confirm upload.

**Actor B (Role: `different user with Clients view permission (e.g., data officer)`)**
- **Session**: `new_session`
- **Navigate To**: `Admin > Organization > Bulk Import -> Clients import history, then navigate to Clients page (Clients listing)`
- **Action**: 
- **Observe**:
  - Import history row for Clients with Import Time matching the recent upload (most recent entry)
  - Import history columns: Completed status (e.g., 'Completed' or completed indicator), Total Records, Success Count, Failure Count, and Download/Results link
  - Clients listing table rows for clients present in the uploaded file showing Name, External ID (or other unique identifier from the file), and Status
  - If available, client detail page for an imported client showing Submitted On/Creation Date matching import time and status (e.g., 'Pending')

**Expected Change**: A new Clients import history entry exists for the uploaded file with status 'Completed' (or completed indicator); Success Count equals the number of records successfully imported (and Failure Count reflects any failed rows). The Clients listing contains the imported client records (matching External ID or Name from the file) and their status is the expected post-import status (typically 'Pending' if imports create pending clients).
