### [TC-002] Unknown Title
**Category**: `positive` | **Verification Type**: `other` | **Coverage**: `partial`

**Coverage Note**: *Receipt of the verification email requires access to the recipient's external email inbox (external system) and so cannot be fully verified in-app. Partial verification can be done via login behavior and by checking the user record via admin UI or API to confirm account creation and email_verified status.*

**Original Test Case Description:**
> No description available.

**Original Steps:**
1. 1. Attempt to navigate to <protected page> (enter protected page URL or click link to protected page)

### [TC-001] Unknown Title
**Category**: `positive` | **Verification Type**: `other` | **Coverage**: `partial`

**Coverage Note**: *Fully proving the backend state (email delivery and creation of a reset token) requires access to the recipient's email inbox or server logs/database. If those are not accessible, only the in-app confirmation message can be verified.*

**Original Test Case Description:**
> No description available.

**Original Steps:**
1. 1. Click the Logout button in the action bar

---

#### Verification Plan

**Pre-Check**
- **Navigate To**: `Forgot Password page`
- **Observe**:
  - Email input field is present and empty
  - No password reset confirmation message currently visible on the page
  - If inbox is accessible: note timestamp of most recent password-reset-related email for the test address (expect none related to this test)

**Post-Check**
- **Navigate To**: `Forgot Password page (or returned confirmation UI)`
- **Observe**:
  - In-app confirmation message displayed (e.g., 'If this email is registered, a reset link has been sent' or 'Password reset link sent to your email')
  - If inbox is accessible: a new email is received at the registered address within a short time window with a subject referencing password reset
  - If inbox is accessible: the email body contains a reset link (URL) that points to the application and includes a unique token or identifier
  - If inbox/access to server logs is available: a password reset record/token exists in server logs or database associated with the registered email and has an expiry (expected ~24 hours)

**Expected Change**: A password reset record/token is created for the registered email and the system sends a password reset email containing a valid reset link; the UI displays a confirmation message. If the reset link is followed, it opens the password reset page allowing setting a new password; the token is time-limited (expires within ~24 hours).
