---

#### Verification Plan

**Pre-Check**
- **Navigate To**: `Course page (ensure Edit mode is ON) -> Relevant section containing the activities`
- **Observe**:
  - names/identifiers of the activities that are selected for the bulk action
  - current visibility/status badges or icons for each selected activity (e.g., Visible, Hidden)
  - current section location or position index for each selected activity
  - total activity count in the source section

**Post-Check**
- **Navigate To**: `Course page (refresh the page and remain in Edit mode) -> Same section(s) as pre-check and any target section(s) if applicable`
- **Observe**:
  - names/identifiers of the previously selected activities
  - visibility/status badges or icons for those activities
  - section location or position index for those activities
  - activity count in the source section and in the target section (if move/duplicate was applied)

**Expected Change**: The previously selected activities persistently reflect the chosen bulk operation: for example, if 'Hide' was applied their visibility badge changes from Visible to Hidden; if 'Show' was applied the badge changes to Visible; if 'Move to section X' the activities no longer appear in the original section and appear under section X at the expected position; if 'Duplicate' additional copies appear (n+number_of_duplicates) with identifiable names/markers; if 'Delete' the activities are no longer present; for status/configuration operations the corresponding indicator or setting for each affected activity is updated. These changes remain visible after a page refresh.

#### Verification Plan

**Pre-Check**
- **Navigate To**: `Course page (with Edit mode ON) -> click '+ Add an activity or resource' to open the Activity Chooser modal`
- **Observe**:
  - identify the target activity tile by label and type (e.g., 'Assignment')
  - target tile star/favorite icon state (record as 'favorited' if filled/active, or 'not favorited' if outline/inactive)

**Post-Check**
- **Navigate To**: `From the course page, close the Activity Chooser, navigate elsewhere on the course page (e.g., a different section) then click '+ Add an activity or resource' again to re-open the Activity Chooser modal`
- **Observe**:
  - the same target activity tile by label and type (must match pre_check identification)
  - target tile star/favorite icon state (filled/active vs outline/inactive)
  - any change in tile placement or visual highlighting associated with favorited tiles (if applicable)

**Expected Change**: The target tile's star/favorite icon state is the opposite of what was recorded in pre_check (if pre_check recorded 'not favorited', post_check shows 'favorited', and vice versa). The toggled favorite state persists when the Activity Chooser is closed and reopened in the same user session.
